            Bug tracking System software is the system for monitoring bugs or errors during software
            testing. It is also referred to as defect tracking or issue tracking. Large systems may have
            hundreds or thousands of defects. Each needs to be evaluated, monitored and prioritized for
            debugging. In some cases, bugs may need to be tracked over a long period of time.
